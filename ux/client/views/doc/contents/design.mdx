# <a name="design" />Design

The problem `pet` is trying to solve is rather complex. We are looking to build a framework for
exploring mission configurations and assessing their performance. There are many moving parts in
setting up a mission simulation, and the problem is more complex during the mission design phase
where it's not yet clear what the actual parts are.

Concepts from object oriented programming can help simplify the task. Using NISAR as an example, one
can argue that the Earth is the <Protocol>Observable</Protocol> and the instrument is an
<Protocol>Observer</Protocol>. The operational details and the data gathering can be abstracted as
an <Protocol>Observation</Protocol>.

Let's flesh out the <Protocol>Observer</Protocol> concept a bit further. One can argue that a
<Protocol>Mission</Protocol> is a kind of <Protocol>Observer</Protocol>, with
<Component>NISAR</Component> being a specific mission. The NISAR mission flies a
<Component>Spacecraft</Component>, a kind of <Protocol>Craft</Protocol>. There are many types of
craft: <Protocol>Aircraft</Protocol>, <Protocol>Orbiter</Protocol>, and <Protocol>Lander</Protocol>,
 to name a few. More specifically, the NISAR spacecraft is an <Protocol>Orbiter</Protocol> that
carries two <Component>NISAR</Component> instruments, each a <Protocol>SAR</Protocol>, which is a
type of <Protocol>Instrument</Protocol>. Typically, it is easy to distinguish from context whether
one is using NISAR to refer to the mission or the instruments. When modelling this in a language
that supports object oriented programming, these would be our abstract base classes that define our
vocabulary and set the stage for modelling complex missions.

Actually, we can generalize these ideas a bit more. Let's support missions that fly constellations
by requiring that <Protocol>Mission</Protocol> hold a list of <Protocol>Craft</Protocol>. In turn,
<Protocol>Craft</Protocol> may carry more than one <Protocol>Instrument</Protocol>.

### <a name="design.pyre" />Leveraging <Pyre/>
When experimenting with mission design, it is important to be able to quickly assemble a mission by
selecting which craft to fly and loading them with instruments. A good object oriented
implementation simplifies this process quite a bit by providing a clear mapping between the words
one would use to describe the mission particulars and the set of classes that must be instantiated
to build it. Unfortunately, object oriented programming doesn't go far enough for our purposes.
Reconfiguring a mission requires changes to the source code of the mission script, a process that
requires skill and entails risk.

Ideally, we would like to let the end user assemble the mission parts from some human readable
configuration file, a web form, or even the command line. This is a form of [inversion of
control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control). User inputs can be validated,
mistakes can be caught and reported, all without touching the source code of the application. The
<Pyre/> framework augments the python typing system with the machinery necessary to accomplish
 this inversion and give end users the power to control the application composition.

In <Pyre/>, concrete classes that are accessible by the end user are called *components*. Component
attributes that are configurable by the end user are called *traits* and are specially marked so
that <Pyre/> can identify them. The abstract classes that set the requirements are called
*protocols*. Components *implement* protocols, but do not derive from them, which completely
decouples the classes that describe requirements from the classes that satisfy these requirements,
as far as python is concerned. One can express the requirement that <Protocol>Craft</Protocol>
carry a list of <Protocol>Instrument</Protocol>, and let the user specify at runtime which specific
types of instruments are instantiated to be carried by the mission craft. Details about how to code
up these relationships are in the following sections.

### <a name="design.mission" />Fleshing out the mission abstractions

Let's start building the code, starting with the protocols. By convention, each source file contains
one class and their names match. The `pet` protocols all live in `pet/protocols`, so feel
free to peek there for the actual implementation. `pet` imports `pyre` under the hood and
publishes a subset of the framework capabilities as its own.

The most basic concept so far has been the <Protocol>Instrument</Protocol>. Its implementation is in
 `pet/protocols/Instrument.py`:

 ``` python
 # support
 import pet

 # the instrument protocol
 class Instrument(pet.protocol, family="pet.instruments"):
    """
    The requirements that all instruments must satisfy
    """

 # end of file
 ```

<Protocol>Instrument</Protocol> is a protocol because it derives from `pet.protocol`. We don't
have much in terms of explicit requirements just yet. The `family` setting in the `Instrument` class
declaration marks the protocol as public, i.e. visible to the end user. It's role is to provide
context for component resolution, as will see in a bit. By convention, the family names of
protocols are plural nouns.

<Protocol>SAR</Protocol> is a subclass of <Protocol>Instrument</Protocol>, so it is also a protocol.
Its definition is in `pet/protocols/SAR.py`:

``` python
# superclass
from .Instrument import Instrument

# the SAR requirements
class SAR(Instrument, family="pet.instruments.sar"):
    """
    The requirements for SAR instruments
    """

# end of file
```

Note that its family name is scoped within the <Protocol>Instrument</Protocol> family, also by
convention. These conventions are meaningful to <Pyre/>, so it's a good idea to follow them.

The <Pyre/> framework provides a visual language for expressing everything we have done so far:

<Picture src="figures/protocols-instrument.png" width="30%" />

The two protocols are shown with their family names. The arrow indicates that
<Protocol>SAR</Protocol> is a subclass of <Protocol>Instrument</Protocol> and points from a class
towards its base.

We now have the vocabulary necessary to specify a <Protocol>Craft</Protocol>. In
`pet/protocols/Craft.py`:

``` python
# support
import pet

# parts
from .Instrument import Instrument

# the platform that carries the mission instruments
class Craft(pet.protocol, family="pet.craft"):
    """
    The craft requirements
    """

    # required state
    instruments = pet.properties.list(schema=Instrument())
    instruments.doc = "the list of instruments on this craft"

# end of file
```

Just like <Protocol>Instrument</Protocol>, <Protocol>Craft</Protocol> derives from `pet.protocol`
and has a family name. The new feature is the `instruments` class attribute. It is declared to be a
list of <Protocol>Instrument</Protocol> instances and is now required state for all components that
implement <Protocol>Craft</Protocol>. Non-conforming components are flagged at compile time, and
their instances are not permitted to be members of `instruments`.

<Protocol>Orbiter</Protocol> is a kind of <Protocol>Craft</Protocol>. In
`pet/protocols/Orbiter.py`:

``` python
# superclass
from .Craft import Craft

# orbiters are craft
class Orbiter(Craft, family="pet.craft.orbiters"):
    """
    Requirements for orbiters
    """

    # required state
    naif = pet.properties.int()
    naif.doc = "the optional NAIF code for this orbiter"

# end of file
```

In addition to requiring its implementers to have a list of instruments, a requirement inherited
from <Protocol>Craft</Protocol>, <Protocol>Orbiter</Protocol> specifies that its implementers must
have an integer NAIF code, as understood by `spice`. The graphical equivalent of the two protocol
declarations is:

<Picture src="figures/protocols-craft.png" width="40%" />

Note that the attribute names are followed by a shorthand that indicates their type.

Finally, a <Protocol>Mission</Protocol> can now be defined as:

<Picture src="figures/protocols-mission.png" width="25%" />

You should be able to translate this diagram into the following code in
`pet/protocols/Mission.py`:

``` python
# support
import pet

# parts
from .Craft import Craft

# the mission protocol
class Mission(pet.protocol, family="pet.missions"):
    """
    The mission requirements
    """

    # required state
    craft = pet.properties.list(schema=Craft())
    craft.doc = "the constellation of craft that carry the mission instruments"

# end of file
```

Earlier, we mentioned that <Protocol>Mission</Protocol> can be thought of as a kind of
<Protocol>Observer</Protocol>, which would imply that <Protocol>Mission</Protocol> should be
declared a subclass of <Protocol>Observer</Protocol>. We skipped this extra level of abstraction
here, but we may have to revisit if we find ourselves having to refer to abstract observers in any
part of our application.

### <a name="design.nisar" />Implementing the NISAR mission components

We are ready to start tackling the classes that implement these abstractions. First up, the
<Component>NISAR</Component> mission, whose graphical representation is:

<Picture src="figures/components-nisar-mission.png" width="75%" />

<Component>NISAR</Component> is a component that implements <Protocol>Mission</Protocol>, a
relationship that is denoted by the line with the ball on the end near the protocol. The
<Component>NISAR</Component> family name is scoped within the family name of its protocol, a
convention that simplifies component resolution, as we'll see later on. Note that the attribute
`craft` is declared to be a list of <Protocol>Orbiter</Protocol>, rather than a list of
<Protocol>Craft</Protocol> as specified by <Protocol>Mission</Protocol>. This is ok with <Pyre/>
because <Protocol>Orbiter</Protocol> is a subclass of <Protocol>Craft</Protocol>, so the stated
requirement is satisfied.

The `craft` declaration also specifies an empty list as its default value. Instances of the
<Component>NISAR</Component> mission will not have any orbiters unless configured otherwise. We
explicitly avoid setting up the default as a list containing the actual NISAR
<Component>Spacecraft</Component> so that we can detect whether the end user configured their
mission instance with a list of orbiters. More on this later.

The code for <Component>NISAR</Component> is in `pet/missions/nisar/NISAR.py`:

``` python
# support
import pet

# the NISAR mission
class NISAR(pet.component, family="pet.missions.nisar", implements=pet.protocols.mission):
    """
    The NISAR mission
    """

    # user configurable state
    craft = pet.properties.list(schema=pet.protocols.orbiter())
    craft.default = []
    craft.doc = "the constellation of craft that carry the mission instruments"

# end of file
```

Note the new argument `implements` in the class declaration; it asks <Pyre/> to verify at compile
time that <Component>NISAR</Component> implements <Protocol>Mission</Protocol> correctly.


The NISAR <Component>Spacecraft</Component> component looks like this:

<Picture src="figures/components-nisar-spacecraft.png" width="75%" />

<Component>Spacecraft</Component> instances have a default `naif` code of `-198`, the value assigned
to the NISAR orbiter by the `spice` kernels. Their `instruments` are expected to implement
<Protocol>SAR</Protocol>, a requirement more stringent than <Protocol>Orbiter</Protocol> requires
as a subclass of <Protocol>Craft</Protocol>.

The implementation of the NISAR <Component>Spacecraft</Component> is in
`pet/missions/nisar/Spacecraft.py`:

``` python
# support
import pet

# the NISAR spacecraft
class Spacecraft(pet.component, family="pet.craft.orbiters.nisar", implements=pet.protocols.orbiter):
    """
    The NISAR spacecraft
    """

    # configurable state
    # the NAIF code
    naif = pet.properties.int()
    naif.default = -198
    naif.doc = "the NAIF id of the NISAR spacecraft"

    # instruments carried by this spacecraft
    instruments = pet.properties.list(schema=pet.protocols.sar())
    instruments.default = []
    instruments.doc = "the list of instruments carried by the NISAR spacecraft"

# end of file
```

Finally, the <Component>NISAR</Component> instrument is given by:

<Picture src="figures/components-nisar-instrument.png" width="75%" />

It includes `modes`, a new trait that is not required by its protocol. This is supposed to capture
the list of <Protocol>BeamMode</Protocol> modes that are available from the instrument configuration.
We will have to add <Protocol>BeamMode</Protocol> to the `pet` protocols before implementing the
<Component>NISAR</Component> component in `pet/instruments/NISAR.py`:

``` python
# support
import pet

# superclass
from .Instrument import Instrument

# the NISAR instrument
class NISAR(Instrument, family="pet.instruments.nisar", implements=pet.protocols.sar):
    """
    The NISAR instrument
    """

    # user configurable state
    # beam modes
    modes = pet.properties.list(schema=pet.protocols.beam())
    modes.default = []
    modes.doc = "the list of beam modes supported by this instrument"

# end of file
```

We have also added a base <Component>Instrument</Component> that derives from `pet.component` to
simplify the implementation of instruments in `pet/instruments/Instrument.py`. The name collision
between the protocol <Protocol>Instrument</Protocol> and the component
<Component>Instrument</Component> will not cause us any trouble because these two are easy to
differentiate from context. Besides, <Component>Instrument</Component> doesn't have a `family` name,
as you can see below, so it is marked as an implementation detail not visible to the end user.

``` python
# support
import pet

# the base instrument
class Instrument(pet.component, implements=pet.protocols.instrument):
    """
    The base instrument
    """

# end of file
```

The graphical representation of <Component>NISAR</Component> does not have to disclose that it has a
base class other than `pet.component`. Note that <Component>NISAR</Component> must implement a
protocol that is compatible with the protocol implemented by <Component>Instrument</Component>,
otherwise <Pyre/> complains at compile time.

For completeness, here is the code for <Protocol>BeamMode</Protocol> that lives in
`pet/protocols/BeamMode.py`:

``` python
# support
import pet

# beam modes
class BeamMode(pet.protocol, family="pet.instruments.sar.beams"):
    """
    Requirements for the beam mode of SAR instruments
    """

# end of file
```

### <a name="design.layout" />Package layout

Let's assemble the physical layout of the `pet` python package so far.

``` text
pet
  +- __init__.py
  +- protocols
  |    +- __init__.py
  |    +- Mission.py
  |    +- Craft.py
  |    +- Orbiter.py
  |    +- Instrument.py
  |    +- SAR.py
  |    +- BeamMode.py
  +- instruments
  |    +- __init__.py
  |    +- Instrument.py
  |    `- NISAR.py
  `- missions
       +- __init__.py
       `- nisar
            +- __init__.py
            +- NISAR.py
            `- Spacecraft.py
```

All directories within this layout require an `__init__.py` file in order to be importable by
python. The file may be empty, but it must exist. However, these files provide an opportunity to
control precisely what a submodule wants to publish. When python encounters `import pet`, it
relies on the contents of the file `pet/__init__.py` to provide the list of accessible symbols.
In order to tie some of the loose ends of the code we've seen so far, we need something like this

``` python filename="pet/__init__.py"
# pyre
# component building blocks
from pyre import protocol, component
# for marking protocol and component interface
from pyre import provides, export
# for building an app
from pyre import application

# publish the submodules
from . import protocols
from . import instruments
from . import missions

# end of file
```

The `pet/protocols/__init__.py` file in turn exports

``` python
# instruments
from .Instrument import Instrument as instrument
from .BeamMode import BeamMode as beam
from .SAR import SAR as sar

# craft
from .Craft import Craft as craft
from .Orbiter import Orbiter as orbiter

# missions
from .Mission import Mission as mission

# end of file
```

making it possible to use an expression like `pet.protocols.mission` when specifying the protocol
implemented by the <Component>NISAR</Component> mission. The symbol renaming let's us hide the name
of the class that contains the actual implementation behind some name that we publish to the package
user. If we later decide to refactor this implementation, we can do so without disturbing users by
merely providing a functional equivalent for the symbol that they rely on.

Similarly, the `pet/instruments/__init__.py` provides access to the <Component>NISAR</Component>
instrument constructor

``` python
# instrument foundries
from .NISAR import NISAR as nisar

# end of file
```

The `pet/missions/__init__.py` just pulls in the symbols from its subdirectory

``` python
# publish the known missions
from .nisar import nisar

# end of file
```

and relies on `pet/missions/nisar/__init__.py` to provide access to the mission constructor

``` python
# the mission foundry
from .NISAR import NISAR as nisar

# end of file
```

This layout now wires the expression `pet.missions.nisar(...)` straight through to the constructor
of the <Component>NISAR</Component> mission component, and `pet.instruments.nisar(...)` to the
corresponding instrument constructor.

### <a name="design.reports" />Configuration reports

Everything we have done so far is rather abstract. The protocols <Protocol>Mission</Protocol>,
<Protocol>Craft</Protocol>, and <Protocol>Instrument</Protocol> enabled us to describe the
relationships between our abstractions. The NISAR specific components we have built don't do very
much just yet. We can start with something simple: let's add a method `report` to our components
that just prints some identifying information. In the [next](#design.app) section, we will write a
simple application that assembles a mission instance and just prints configuration information.

This simple example is an excellent opportunity to introduce `journal`, a logging facility that
comes with <Pyre/>. `journal` predates the `logging` module from the python standard library by a
decade and half. It has some features that make it uniquely suitable for the kinds of application
written by <Pyre/> users. This is not a comprehensive tutorial on how to use `journal` but we will
see enough features to get an introduction to the basics.

Let's start with <Component>Instrument</Component>, the base class of all instrument
implementations. The implementation in `pet/instruments/Instrument.py` becomes:

``` python
# support
import pet

# the base instrument
class Instrument(pet.component, implements=pet.protocols.instrument):
    """
    The base instrument
    """

    # interface
    def report(self, channel):
        """
        Render my configuration to the given journal {channel}
        """
        # sign on
        channel.line(f"{self}")
        # all done
        return

# end of file
```

We can exercise the new capability from the python prompt:

``` text
~/dv/pet> python3
>>> import pet
>>> import journal
>>> channel = journal.info(name="pet")
>>> lBand = pet.instruments.nisar(name="L-band")
>>> lBand.report(channel=channel)
>>> channel.log()
journal: component 'L-band', an instance of 'pet.instruments.nisar'
```

The first two lines give us access to the `pet` and `journal` packages. Then we build a `channel`
of type `info` and instantiate a <Component>NISAR</Component> instrument. Configuring a component
requires knowing its name. In complex applications with many components, it pays to come up with a
consistent naming strategy to avoid accidental name collisions. After instantiation, we ask our
component instance to `report` to our `channel` and then flush it. This produces the output shown.
The <Component>NISAR</Component> instrument instance has access the method `report` of
<Component>Instrument</Component> because it is one of its subclasses.

Our <Component>NISAR</Component> instrument has beam `modes`. Let's add them to the `report`:

``` python
# support
import pet

# superclass
from .Instrument import Instrument

# the NISAR instrument
class NISAR(Instrument, family="pet.instruments.nisar", implements=pet.protocols.sar):
    """
    The NISAR instrument
    """

    # user configurable state
    # beam modes
    modes = pet.properties.list(schema=pet.protocols.beam())
    modes.default = []
    modes.doc = "the list of beam modes supported by this instrument"

    # interface
    def report(self, channel):
        """
        Render my state in the given journal {channel}
        """
        # chain up
        super().report(channel=channel)
        # get my modes
        modes = self.modes
        # indent
        channel.indent()
        # report the mode count
        channel.line(f"modes: {len(modes)}")
        # outdent
        channel.outdent()
        # all done
        return

# end of file
```

 The implementation of `report` in <Component>NISAR</Component> starts by chaining up to the
 `report` of <Component>Instrument</Component>, and then adds the number of beam modes to the
 output. Repeating our last session at the python prompt gives:

``` text
~/dv/pet> python3
>>> import pet
>>> import journal
>>> channel = journal.info(name="pet")
>>> sBand = pet.instruments.nisar(name="s-band")
>>> sband.report(channel=channel)
>>> channel.log()
journal:
 -- component 's-band', an instance of 'pet.instruments.nisar'
 --   modes: 0
```

We can add a similar capability to the NISAR <Component>Spacecraft</Component> in
`pet/missions/nisar/Spacecraft.py`:

``` python
# support
import pet

# the NISAR spacecraft
class Spacecraft(pet.component, family="pet.craft.orbiters.nisar", implements=pet.protocols.orbiter):
    """
    The NISAR spacecraft
    """

    # configurable state
    # the NAIF code
    naif = pet.properties.int()
    naif.default = -198
    naif.doc = "the NAIF id of the NISAR spacecraft"

    # instruments carried by this spacecraft
    instruments = pet.properties.list(schema=pet.protocols.sar())
    instruments.default = []
    instruments.doc = "the list of instruments carried by the NISAR spacecraft"

    # interface
    def report(self, channel):
        """
        Render my configuration in the given journal {channel}
        """
        # sign on
        channel.line(f"{self}")
        # indent
        channel.indent()
        # report my NAIf code
        channel.line(f"NAIF id: {self.naif}")
        # go through my instruments
        for idx, instrument in enumerate(self.instruments):
            # mark
            channel.line(f"instrument {idx}:")
            # indent
            channel.indent()
            # ask the instrument to report
            instrument.report(channel=channel)
            # outdent
            channel.outdent()
        # outdent
        channel.outdent()
        # all done
        return

# end of file
```

and to the <Component>NISAR</Component> mission in `pet/missions/nisar/NISAR.py`:

``` python
# support
import pet

# the NISAR mission
class NISAR(pet.component, family="pet.missions.nisar", implements=pet.protocols.mission):
    """
    The NISAR mission
    """

    # user configurable state
    craft = pet.properties.list(schema=pet.protocols.orbiter())
    craft.default = []
    craft.doc = "the constellation of craft that carry the mission instruments"

    # interface
    def report(self, channel):
        """
        Render my configuration in the given journal {channel}
        """
        # sign on
        channel.line(f"{self}")
        # indent
        channel.indent()
        # go through my craft
        for idx, craft in enumerate(self.craft):
            # mark
            channel.line(f"craft {idx}:")
            # indent
            channel.indent()
            # ask the craft to report
            craft.report(channel=channel)
            # and outdent
            channel.outdent()
        # outdent
        channel.outdent()
        # all done
        return

# end of file
```

By default, <Component>NISAR</Component> missions have an empty list of `craft`, and
<Component>Spacecraft</Component> carry no `instruments`, so running these reports with the default
configuration does not produce exciting output. We fix this in the next section, where we show how
the end user can take control of mission construction.

### <a name="design.app" />Assembling a concrete mission

In this section, we will build and configure a simple mission application. We are assuming that you
have been following along with the code changes and you have assembled a `pet` package with the
layout shown in a [previous](#design.layout) section. Alternatively, if you already have `pet`
installed and accessible by python, everything shown here will also work exactly the same.

Go to some directory outside the `pet` source tree, say `~/tmp/pet`, and create a script
`mission.py` with the following content:

``` python
#! /usr/bin/env python3

# support
import pet
import journal

# the app
class MissionApp(pet.application, family="pet.apps.mission"):
    """
    A simple application to showcase mission configuration
    """

    # user configurable state
    mission = pet.protocols.mission()
    mission.doc = "the mission"

    # application interface obligations
    @pet.export
    def main(self, *args, **kwds):
        """
        The main entry point
        """
        # get my mission
        mission = self.mission
        # if it's non-trivial
        if mission:
            # make a channel
            channel = journal.info("pet.app")
            # ask my mission to report its configuration
            mission.report(channel=channel)
            # and flush
            channel.log()
        # all done
        return 0

# bootstrap
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # instantiate the app
    app = MissionApp(name="pet.app")
    # launch it
    status = app.run()
    # and share its status with the shell
    raise SystemExit(status)

# end of file
```

The first line of the script tells the shell to execute using python. Let's give it execute
permissions:

``` text
~/tmp/pet> chmod +x mission.py
```

You can now run this script. There should be no errors, but also not much output. That's because the
default value for the application `mission` trait is `None`, and the logic in the `main` entry point
skips past the report generation in that case.

``` text
~/tmp/pet> ./mission.py
~/tmp/pet>
```

Our <Component>MissionApp</Component> is a <Component>pet.application</Component>, which itself is
a component, so the lines that declare the `mission` trait should be familiar by now. One new
feature here is the `@pet.export` decorator above the declaration of `main`. That's how you tell
<Pyre/> that a given function is meant to satisfy some requirement imposed by the protocol a
component implements. At the bottom of the script is the boilerplate code necessary to launch a
python script. In our cases, we just instantiate the app, run it, and share its exit code with the
shell.

Subclasses of <Component>pet.application</Component> inherit a lot of behavior supplied by the
<Pyre/> framework. An easy one to see is getting help running the app. Try:

``` text
~/tmp/pet> ./mission.py --help

    A simple application to showcase mission configuration

  usage:
    pet.app [options]

  options:
    --mission: the mission [pet.missions]
      --shell: my hosting strategy [pyre.shells]
      --DEBUG: debugging mode [bool]
```

This simple help screen is generated automatically by our <Component>MissionApp</Component> through
introspection, using its `docstring` as the application description, and going through its pile of
traits to form the list of command line arguments understood by the app. As you may have guessed,
there is a one to one correspondence between traits and command line arguments. More on this later.

Building an interesting mission does not require any changes to our source code. It can all be done
from a user supplied configuration file. Let's create `pet.yaml` in the same directory as
`mission.py`.

``` yaml
# -*- yaml -*-

# bind the application mission to a NISAR mission named "example"
mission: nisar#example

# the configuration of the example mission
example:
  # the list of spacecraft flown by the mission
  craft:
    - nisar#primary

# the configuration of the primary spacecraft
primary:
  # the list of instruments carried by the craft
  instruments:
    - nisar#L-band
    - nisar#S-band

# end of file
```

Let's unpack what is going on. <Component>MissionApp</Component> has a `mission` trait. The
assignment `mission: nisar#example` will assign to `mission` a component named `example` built with
the `nisar` component factory. The long form for this is `mission: pet.missions.nisar#example`,
but because the <Protocol>Mission</Protocol> family name is `pet.missions` and the layout of our
package mirrors this structure, <Pyre/> seeds the search for the mission factory with
`pet.missions.nisar` automatically. <Pyre/> imports this symbol, checks that it is a component
factory and invokes it as if `mission = pet.missions.nisar(name="example")` were typed in a python
session. Shorthands like this simplify what users have to type and it is one of the main reasons to
lay out family names and the package directory structure in compatible ways.

Similarly, the `example` mission configures its list of `craft` by supplying a `nisar#primary`
specification, which sends <Pyre/> looking for a component that implements `pet.craft.orbiters`. The
<Component>Spacecraft</Component> in `pet/missions/nisar` is known to be one such, and its family
name is `pet.craft.orbiters.nisar`, so there is a match. <Pyre/> then instantiates the
<Component>Spacecraft</Component>, giving it the name `primary`. During the instantiation, the
configuration associated with `primary` is examined. It lists two `instruments`, both of type
`nisar` but with different names. The resolution  mechanism for components that implement
<Protocol>Instrument</Protocol> discovers the <Component>NISAR</Component> instrument as
`pet.instruments.nisar` and instantiates and configures the `L-band` and `S-band` instruments.

It's worth noting that the conventions that helped <Pyre/> make these matches are only simplifying
what the user has to type in the configuration file. Everything would have worked just fine by
providing the full family names to the lists of craft and instruments.

Running the `mission.py` script now produces

``` text
~/tmp/pet>./mission.py
pet:
 -- component 'example', an instance of 'pet.missions.nisar'
 --   craft 0:
 --     component 'primary', an instance of 'pet.craft.orbiters.nisar'
 --       NAIF id: -198
 --       instrument 0:
 --         component 'L-band', an instance of 'pet.instruments.nisar'
 --           modes: 0
 --       instrument 1:
 --         component 'S-band', an instance of 'pet.instruments.nisar'
 --           modes: 0
```

Configuring a hypothetical NISAR mission where there is a companion craft carrying just an L-band
instrument is fairly straightforward:

``` yaml

# bind the application mission to a NISAR mission named "example"
mission: nisar#example

# the configuration of the example mission
example:
  # the list of spacecraft flown by the mission
  craft:
    - nisar#primary
    - nisar#secondary

# the configuration of the primary spacecraft
primary:
  # the list of instruments carried by the craft
  instruments:
    - nisar#L-band
    - nisar#S-band

# the configuration of the secondary spacecraft
secondary:
  # the NAIF id of this craft
  naif: -199
  # the list of instruments carried by the craft
  instruments:
    - nisar#L-band


 # end of file
 ```

The list of `craft` now mentions the `secondary` orbiter, which has a unique NAIF code so we can
specify its orbits and carries a single L-band instrument. Running `mission.py` with the new
configuration yields:

``` text
pet:
 -- component 'example', an instance of 'pet.missions.nisar'
 --   craft 0:
 --     component 'primary', an instance of 'pet.craft.orbiters.nisar'
 --       NAIF id: -198
 --       instrument 0:
 --         component 'L-band', an instance of 'pet.instruments.nisar'
 --           modes: 0
 --       instrument 1:
 --         component 'S-band', an instance of 'pet.instruments.nisar'
 --           modes: 0
 --   craft 1:
 --     component 'secondary', an instance of 'pet.craft.orbiters.nisar'
 --       NAIF id: -199
 --       instrument 0:
 --         component 'L-band', an instance of 'pet.instruments.nisar'
 --           modes: 0
```
